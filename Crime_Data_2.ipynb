        "\n",
        "## 1. Total Crime Counts by County\n",
        "- **Kent** had the highest number of reported crimes, with **200,945** incidents.\n",
        "- **Derbyshire** followed with **110,805** crimes, while **Leicestershire** reported **115,179** crimes.\n",
        "- This indicates that Kent has a significantly higher crime rate compared to the other two counties.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Monthly Crime Trends\n",
        "- The monthly crime trend analysis shows a fluctuating pattern in total crimes across all counties throughout the year.\n",
        "- In **Kent**, there were noticeable peaks in crimes around the mid-year months (especially June to August).\n",
        "- **Derbyshire** exhibited a gradual increase in crime until May, with a slight decrease towards the end of the year.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Crime Type Distribution\n",
        "- **Violence and sexual offences** were the most prevalent crime type across all counties, especially in **Kent** (83,341 crimes) and **Derbyshire** (41,878 crimes).\n",
        "- Other significant crime types included **anti-social behaviour** and **criminal damage and arson**, indicating social issues and property-related concerns.\n",
        "- **Shoplifting** was also notable, particularly in **Kent**, suggesting retail crime as a significant concern.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Crime Type Breakdown by County\n",
        "- Each county has unique crime type distributions:\n",
        "  - In **Derbyshire**, the second most common crime type was **anti-social behaviour**, while in **Kent**, it was significantly higher at **27,904** crimes.\n",
        "  - **Leicestershire** showed a more balanced distribution among different crime types, with notable counts across categories such as **criminal damage and arson** and **other theft**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Visualizations\n",
        "- The **line plot** provided a clear visualization of monthly crime trends, illustrating fluctuations in crime rates by county over the year.\n",
        "- The **bar chart** effectively displayed the distribution of different crime types across the counties, highlighting areas of concern that may require targeted interventions.\n",
        "- The **pie charts** offered a detailed breakdown of crime types for each county, revealing the dominance of certain categories in specific regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Recommendations\n",
        "- **Increased Policing in High Crime Areas**: Given the high crime rates in Kent, a focused strategy to address violence and property crimes may be beneficial.\n",
        "- **Community Engagement**: Initiatives to tackle anti-social behaviour could enhance community safety, particularly in Derbyshire and Kent.\n",
        "- **Retail Security Improvements**: Strengthening security measures in retail environments could help mitigate the risk of shoplifting, especially in urban areas.\n",
